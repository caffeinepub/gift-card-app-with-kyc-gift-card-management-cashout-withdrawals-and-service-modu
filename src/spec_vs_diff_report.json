  "summary": "REQ-1 is partially implemented: `frontend/src/config/nigerianBanks.ts` now includes the required new bank/fintech entries and expands the list. However, based on the provided diff summary, there is not enough evidence that the updated list is actually wired as the single source of truth for `NigerianBankSelect` across both the Withdrawals flow and the Send-to-Bank sheet, or that users can complete payout method creation using these new options without validation/UI issues.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "The updated list remains the single source of truth used by `NigerianBankSelect`, and the new entries appear in bank search results when typing queries like \"kuda\", \"opay\", \"monie\", and \"palm\".",
      "reason": "While the config adds the new entries and introduces `filterBanksByQuery`, the diff summary does not show any changes to `NigerianBankSelect` (or its consumers) confirming it imports/uses this list and filter for search results.",

      "requirement": "Users can successfully add a payout method selecting any of these new options from the searchable dropdown in both the Withdrawals flow and the Send-to-Bank sheet, with no UI crashes or validation dead-ends.",
      "reason": "No code changes are shown for the Withdrawals flow UI, the Send-to-Bank sheet UI, or payout-method creation/validation paths. The diff summary only evidences config/test changes, so end-to-end usability in both locations cannot be verified.",
