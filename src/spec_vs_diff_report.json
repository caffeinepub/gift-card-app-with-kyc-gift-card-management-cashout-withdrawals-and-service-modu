  "summary": "Implemented a reusable searchable bank dropdown (NigerianBankSelect) backed by a centralized Nigerian banks config module, and wired it into both SendToBankSheet and WithdrawalsPage (at least via imports). However, the provided bank list does not appear to be a full Nigerian bank list (several commonly recognized banks are missing).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Add a full Nigerian bank list (maintained static list) in the frontend to be used as selectable options source for payout-method creation.",
      "reason": "A static list exists, but it does not appear to be a full Nigerian bank list as requested by the BuildRequest title/intent; several widely known Nigerian banks are absent from the exported array (e.g., Jaiz Bank).",
