  "summary": "LoginCard.tsx was redesigned toward a screenshot-style login UI with a dark background, white rounded sheet, title, sign-up row, disabled email/password inputs, an Internet Identity helper banner, password visibility toggle, and link-styled buttons. However, the diff is truncated around the Continue button and does not fully evidence required loading/disabled CTA behavior, exact wording, or the non-breaking link/modal behavior. Unrequested changes appear in project_state.json and frontend-file-summaries.txt.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "All user-facing text on this screen is in English and matches the screenshot wording (including capitalization and punctuation).",
      "reason": "The sign-up row uses \"Don't have an account?\" (straight apostrophe) instead of the specified \"Don’t have an account?\" (curly apostrophe). Also, the input placeholders differ from the specified screenshot-style \"email + password\" fields (diff shows \"Enter your email address\" and \"Enter password\"), which may not match the required wording.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Wide rounded \"Continue\" primary CTA at the bottom of the sheet.",
      "reason": "The diff is truncated at the Continue button's onClick handler, so width, placement at the bottom, and rounded styling cannot be verified from the provided summary.",

      "requirement": "Clicking \"Continue\" starts the Internet Identity login flow and shows a loading state (spinner + disabled CTA) while loginStatus is \"logging-in\".",
      "reason": "Although loginStatus/isLoggingIn and handleContinue() calling login() exist, the diff is truncated before the Button props/rendering, so the spinner/disabled CTA behavior while logging in cannot be confirmed.",

      "requirement": "\"Forgot Password?\" and \"Sign up\" are rendered as links/buttons with hover/focus styles and do not break navigation (they may open an informational modal/toast if no dedicated routes exist).",
      "reason": "The buttons have hover styling and click handlers that set showInfoDialog=true, but the actual informational dialog/toast rendering is not shown in the truncated diff, so the non-breaking behavior cannot be verified.",
